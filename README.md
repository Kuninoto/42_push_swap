###  Subject: [push_swap en_subject](./extras/en.subject_push_swap.pdf)

## Note:
Although I was only able to do an algorithm that gives 90/100 in this project (i.e bonus cannot be accessed on the evaluation)
I've still made the bonus part because I found it interesting and quite easy. I left it on bonus folder for the record. 
It has a Norm error on main so that's something to take in consideration if you're a 42 student and want to get inspired.

#### Makefile Available Targets:  
`make` or `make all` - Makes _push_swap_   
`make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files   
`make fclean` - Deletes _push_swap_ and _checker_  
`make re` - fclean + all  
`make bonus` - Makes _checker_

## Disclaimer
> At [42School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)), almost every project must be written in accordance to the [Norm](./extras/en_norm.pdf), the schools' coding standard. As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.
